# Paul Popat's Monorepo

As I normally work on a private git server. I have put my projects up here temporarily, as a monorepo, so as to allow for browsing.

A lot of it is uncomplete and perhaps naive and maybe not my best work. It should, however, give one a good idea of what I am like as a person and a programmer.

Please enjoy.
